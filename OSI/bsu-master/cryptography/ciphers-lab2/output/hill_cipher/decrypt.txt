ONCE IN SCOTLAND A YOUNG MAN WAS SO MUCH IN LOVE WITH A THAT HE DID NOTHING BUT THINK OF HER NIGHT AND  
DAY AT LAST HE HAD THE COURAGE TO OFFER HER HIS HEART AND ASKED FOR HERS IN RETURN BUT SHE DID NOT SHARE
THE SAME FEELING AS IT CAN HAPPEN SHE SWEETLY SMILED AT HIM AND THEN RAN OFF THE YOUNG MAN WAS LEFT 
FEELING SAD AND DEFEATED THE YOUNG MAN WAS FILLED WITH EMBARRASSMENT HE FELT HE COULD NO LONGER SHOW
HIS FACE AROUND TOWN NOT WITH EVERYONE KNOWING SHE HAD PASSED HIM OVER HE EVEN FISH ANYMORE WITH  
HIS FRIENDS AT THE SHORE FOR HE WAS TOO FULL OF SHAME SO WITH A HEAVY HEART HE GATHERED HIS NETS  
GOT INSIDE HIS BOAT AND SAILED OFF TO A DESERTED ISLAND HE BUILT HIMSELF A HUT AND EVERY MORNING
VERY EARLY SAILED TO SEA THERE HE WOULD CAST HIS NETS AND HOPEFULLY HAUL IN A DAYS CATCH HE TOOK  
HIS CATCH TO THE CLOSEST SHORE PORT WHERE NO ONE KNEW HIS FACE HE WOULD SELL HIS FISH TO THE LOCAL
MARKET AND WITH THE MONEY HE EARNED BUY FOOD AND OTHER NECESSITIES AND SAIL BACK HOME TO HIS ISLAND 
SUCH WAS HIS LIFE DAY AFTER DAY THEN ONE DAY THE CORNER OF HIS EYE CAUGHT SOMETHING GLEAMING WITH 
THE FISH IN HIS NET QUICKLY HE GRABBED IT WITH ONE HAND THOUGH IT TWISTED AND THRASHED AND HE TIED
THE NET INTO A KNOT SO THAT WHATEVER IT WAS COULD NOT ESCAPE
